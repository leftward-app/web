# Mission - Values - Vetting

## Our Mission
**We build tools that remove the barriers between values and action.**

In the United States of America, there is overwhelming popular support for progressive policy. Most understand that a more equal, more just, and more democratic America is a better one - and yet so much stands between The People and bringing about this change. We clear away these barriers by providing vetted, impactful actions to anyone who wants to bring about a better world. 

By matching the needs of organizers to activists looking for an opportunity to make change, we:
- Empower Organizers by amplifying the impact of campaings, policy agendas, and direct action 
- Mobilize Activists by providing concrete ways to support the causes they care about, at any contribution level 


## The Problem we Solve

There’s a lot in the way between a desire to change the world and taking effective action to do so:
```
Identify values
Map that onto a change in the world
Research how to bring about that change
Find an agent or organization that promotes that change
Vet that organization for legitimacy
Vet that organization for effectiveness
Contact that organization and begin a relationship
Identify specific ways to contribute
Create an action plan for that contribution
Coordinate that contribution
Act
```

People get lost at each step. This results in inaction, guilt, and anxiety. It contributes to the erosion of democracy and creates an America where people believe they can’t make a difference.

To make moving from values to action as direct and effective as possible, we curate and vet organizations and opportunities that strike at the root cause of these issues. Because of our involvement, we are committed to a transparent process. It starts with this document.

We search for actions and partner with organizations that:
1. Are aligned with the values we promote
2. Are likely to lead to real, permanent change

## The Values we Promote
### Economic Justice
We believe that the state of wealth and income inequality in the United States is at an unjust and unsustainable level. All workers have the right to organize and fight for a living wage. All workers deserve safe, just, and non-demeaning employment conditions. All workers deserve vacation time, reasonable hours, and other workplace protections and rights.
### Legal Justice
We believe the United States’ system of mass incarceration, police brutality, and the disparate application of the law based on class is unconscionable. We strive to dismantle the gender and racial injustices structurally present in our criminal justice system. We strive for an accountable criminal justice system that serves the people. We strive for sentencing reform, the end to the war on drugs, the end of private prisons, and a system that promotes the dignity and flourishing of all peoples.
### Environmental Justice
We believe the world is in a human-caused climate crisis. This crisis represents a real and serious threat to the entire human race, particularly to the marginalized and unborn. We strive for the end of the age of fossil fuels, decarbonization, corporate accountability for emissions, and the development of community-led renewable energy systems.
### Racial Justice
We strive for the eradication of white supremacy and the dismantling of structural racism. We strive to resolve the foundational and unremedied historical injustices that continue to produce unjust outcomes in economics, education, politics, criminal justice, and beyond along racial and ethnic lines. 
### Gender and LGBTQ+ Justice
We affirm and protect the rights of our gay, lesbian, bi, queer, trans, or gender non-conforming fellow humans. We believe in equal pay for equal work. We affirm reproductive rights. This includes access to comprehensive healthcare, name and gender changes on identity documents, and full anti-discrimination protections.

## How we Vet
To fulfill our mission, we discover, curate, and share actions that manifest our values. Before we share an action, we make sure of the following:
- The sponsoring organization’s mission is aligned with Leftward’s values.
- The action is aimed at fundamental change.
- The action is likely to succeed at its purpose.
- The action is one specific thing to do.

We continually strive to make the best judgment we can. In all things, we are committed to allowing no financial or external bias in our vetting process. Here are some guidelines as to how we do it. If you have any specific questions about an action, reach out to us at hello@leftward.app. 

We confirm the action is a single, specific thing to do. 
- Can it be completed/attended/done? 
- Does it have a specific timeframe? 
- Does it have clear success criteria?

We look at the values promoted by the action and the organization or individual sponsoring it. 
- Do they match our values? 
- Does the action fit into a policy or reform agenda we’ve articulated and shared?
- What are the potential side effects and consequences of this action that might not be obvious? 
- What are alternative action options?

We investigate if this action targets the root cause of an issue. 
- Is this action treating the symptoms of the issue, or is it addressing the cause?
- Does this action target structural issues? 
- If this action reaches its goals, is it likely to permanently change the world for the better? 
- Does this action move policy forward in a more progressive way?

We examine how likely the action is to succeed at its goals. 
- Is this action well intentioned, but impractical? 
- Is this an effective use of time and effort? 
- If this action doesn’t succeed, does it still accomplish valuable change, or produce momentum? 
- Does this action have any special relevance or social momentum that needs to be acted on now?

We look at the action and it’s result through the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
- Does this action make sense to promote from a diverse set of perspectives? 
- How does our analysis change based on a perspective from someone with different privilege, identity, or class? 
- Is this action endorsed by any academic perspectives or theories? 
- Are there any other vetted organizations, experts, or public figures promoting the action? 

As we grow, we are always working to make our process more transparent and include more voices. We invite community criticism, and commit to the continual improvement of our vetting process

In the future, we expect to build partnerships with progressive organizations, expand to using policy analysis and reform plans to generate actions, and potentially even work to partner on legislation. For now, we’re taking it one step at a time. If you would like to help us identify actions, would like to submit specific actions, or are an organization interested in partnership, reach out to us at hello@leftward.app.
